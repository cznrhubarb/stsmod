# Muscle Man Tot Mod

This is a Slay the Spire mod based on the (muscle) man, the myth, the legend, Tot.

Join Tot as he climbs the Spire in search of bagels. Relive all your favorite Tot lore like:
* That time he ate half of Amy's bagels and threw up on the other half.
* That time he befriended a raccoon.
* That time we decided it'd be best off if he was just a little drugged all the time.
* And more!

Many thanks to the people that put in all the work to make modding accessible and also many thanks to Mega Crit for developing Slay the Spire in the first place.
